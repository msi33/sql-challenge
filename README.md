# sql-challenge

1. You are hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company).
2. The frist task is to carry out research about the employees during the 1980s and 1990s.
3. The only available records are six CSV files left behind from employee database.
4. The task is to design the tables to hold the data from CSV files.
5. Initially the CSV files will be imported into a SQL database.
6. This will be followed by answering questions about the data.
7. This Challenge is divided into three parts:
    1. Data modeling
    2. Data engineering
    3. Data analysis.

The activities include
1. Create a new repository for the project called sql-challenge and clone it to local computer.
2. Inside the cloned repo create a directory for the SQL challenge and the add files to it.

For Data Modeling
1. The CSVs are inspected and ERD of the tables are sketched out
2. Tool like http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com could be used for ERD. 

Data Engineering
1. Use the information you have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files.
2. Specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
3. Then import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

Data Analysis
After completing database, do the following:
1. List the details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.
2. List employees who were hired in 1986.
3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number,
 department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.
4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
5. List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
